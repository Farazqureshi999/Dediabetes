  Type 2 diabetes is one of the most widespread chronic diseases in the population and is also the most common type of diabetes. This ailment is characterized by the presence of a high level of sugar in the blood and by being slow to develop over time.


  ## Causes of type 2 diabetes


  The pancreas is in charge of producing and releasing a natural hormone called [insulin](https://dediabetes.com/que-es-la-insulina-cuantos-tipos-existen/) . Its mission is to help transport sugar from the bloodstream to cells throughout the body to be used for energy. Type 2 diabetes causes insulin resistance: the body no longer uses it efficiently and the pancreas must make a great effort to make more. Over time the cells of the pancreas are damaged and eventually this organ can be affected to the point of not being able to generate more insulin.


  When there is not enough insulin production or when it is not used properly, glucose begins to accumulate in the blood and does not reach the cells or organs, so the body is deprived of energy. It is still not possible to specify exactly what the trigger is for this problem, although genetic predisposition, obesity and sedentary lifestyle are considered triggers of type 2 diabetes. Body fat, especially that located around the waist, prevents correct use of insulin.


  ## Symptoms


  When glucose cannot reach the cells of the body, due to the deficit or inefficient use of insulin, the body begins to obtain the energy it needs from its tissues, muscles and organs. Although this type of diabetes is very slow in development and offers weak symptoms that are easy to ignore during the early stages, some of its most common manifestations are the following:


  * constant hunger

  * [excessive thirst](https://dediabetes.com/como-la-deshidratacion-afecta-los-niveles-de-la-glucosa-en-la-sangre/)

  * fatigue

  * frequent urination

  * itchy skin

  * [blurry vision](https://dediabetes.com/recursos-guia-retinopatia/complicaciones-de-la-vista/)

  * weightloss


  As type 2 diabetes progresses and blood sugar levels stay high for a long time, symptoms worsen, and may include:


  * slow-healing wounds

  * fungal infections

  * Feet pain

  * neuropathies

  * Heart problems


  ## Risk factors for type 2 diabetes


  Although science has not yet managed to identify the exact causes of the disease, it is possible to affirm that there are certain factors that increase the risk of suffering from it. Obesity is one of them, since excess fat tissue - especially that located in the abdomen - causes greater resistance to insulin.


  If sedentary lifestyle is added to being overweight, the danger increases as glucose is used when exercising regularly and, in addition, physical activity helps to improve the response of cells to insulin. However, these are conditions that can be modified through changes in eating habits and sports.


  There are also other risk factors over which the patient has no control. They are those related to age - since the predisposition increases after 45 years - and race, since it has been shown that in Caucasians there is a lower incidence of diabetes than in Latinos and African Americans, for example. Having gestational diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome puts women at greater risk. Family inheritance also plays an important role in the appearance of this type of diabetes.


  ## Prevention

  It is not always possible to prevent the onset of the disease, since, as we mentioned in the previous section, some of the risk factors are beyond the control of the patient. However, there are steps that can be taken to delay and even prevent type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle changes are essential in preventing this condition. Following a balanced diet and regular physical activity helps control body weight while maintaining adequate sugar levels.


  The diet should include carbohydrates rich in fiber and nutrients, omega 3 fatty acids, and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Skimmed dairy products should also be consumed, watch the amount of food eaten and respect meal times.


  Practicing aerobic sports daily and staying as active as possible will complement the nutritional plan to achieve weight control and prevent diabetes 2.


  ## Diet


  We have discussed the importance of diet in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels and managing weight. The recommended eating plan for people with type 2 diabetes is easy to follow and is based on following a few key guidelines. It is very important to adhere to the established hours to eat and consume moderate portions. It is advisable to choose foods of high nutritional value, rich in vitamins and minerals and low in empty calories. Among the carbohydrates, it is advisable to choose those that provide fiber, such as whole grains, legumes, fresh vegetables and fruits in season.


  Tuna, sardines, salmon and cod provide omega 3, which is very necessary for heart care. The diabetic's nutritional guideline should also include healthy fats, such as those contained in olive and canola oils, in dried fruits, such as walnuts and almonds, and in avocado. Consumption should be moderate, since they are very convenient foods, but carry a large amount of calories. Fried foods, high-fat dairy, sugary drinks, and processed products should be avoided.


  ## Complications of type 2 diabetes


  This disease can cause numerous health complications, since it is capable of affecting practically all the organs of the human body. It is responsible for triggering cardiovascular diseases, such as high blood pressure, narrowed arteries, heart attack, and stroke.


  It also causes kidney damage and failure, as well as impaired vision, glaucoma, and cataracts. In addition, complications may occur, such as skin infections, neuropathies, and difficulties in wound healing.


  Likewise, type 2 diabetes can lead to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, affecting the patient's quality of life in different ways. On the other hand, this ailment causes problems during pregnancy and childbirth, and may even negatively affect the baby's health.


  ## Diagnosis


  There are three diagnostic tests to measure blood glucose level: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurement, oral glucose tolerance test (OTG), and hemoglobin measurement (A1C).


  When type 2 diabetes is identified early, there is a greater probability of delaying the appearance of the most severe complications derived from this disease. The results of the actions aimed at preventing the progression of this disease always depend on the time elapsed from its appearance to its detection, so early diagnosis is of great importance. The endocrinologist specializing in diabetes is the best professional to treat and control this medical condition.
