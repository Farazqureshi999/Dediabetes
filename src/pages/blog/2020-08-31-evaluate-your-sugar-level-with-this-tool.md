  Monitor your blood sugar level and see if it is in the correct range based on the NICE recommendations for type 1 and type 2 diabetes using this blood sugar level checker.


  ## How do I use the blood sugar checker?


  To use the blood sugar checker, simply:


  * Enter your last blood glucose reading

  * Please specify if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes

  * If you have eaten in the last 30 minutes (before or after the meal)


  Please note: This tool is not intended for use by pregnant women.


  Recommended blood glucose levels have a degree of interpretation for each individual and should be discussed with your physician. Also, women should set goals for what their blood sugar levels should be during pregnancy.


  The ranges used in this tool are based on those provided by the [National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)](https://www.nice.org.uk/) , but the target range for each individual must be agreed upon by their physician on an individual basis.
