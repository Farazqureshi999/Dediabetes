  People with diabetes can have a completely normal life, many women have consulted us on the subject of pregnancy when they have diabetes, especially [type 1 diabetes](https://dediabetes.com/que-es-la-diabetes-mellitus-tipo-i/) . Some frequently asked questions are Can I come out in a state with diabetes? Will I pass diabetes to my child? Will there be any complications in the pregnancy? And to respond to these and many other concerns we develop this post.


  ## Your baby can be completely healthy


  All women with diabetes can be perfectly healthy and have a completely healthy child. Scientific evidence indicates that having diabetes does not make the process of being able to get pregnant more difficult, which does manifest is that it only requires optimal control of blood sugar or glycemia before and during pregnancy.


  ## Type 1 Diabetes and Pregnancy: How You Should Take Care of Yourself


  The greatest care should be established before the 15th week of gestation since in this way complications, congenital abnormalities (because most of the organs are formed in the first weeks of gestation) are avoided and the risk of death of both of them.


  ## Problems with a pregnancy without the necessary care


  If the pregnant woman does not take proper care of her blood glucose levels, it is common for her to give birth to a macrosomic baby, that is, it is very large and heavy because it was “overfed” by so much glucose in the blood. Although this child is born without complications, due to the fact that it was macrosomic, it is already at greater risk of developing diabetes and other chronic diseases when it reaches adulthood.


  Another aspect to keep in mind is that if you have a poorly controlled pregnancy in terms of blood glucose, especially in the last weeks of gestation, you are more likely to require a cesarean section to deliver your baby.


  On the other hand, the most worrying complications for parents are the birth of premature children, that is, before the term of pregnancy, which becomes more likely as blood sugar increases, and worries because these premature children frequently present problems breathing, to see, also an inadequate process of digestion, in the function of the heart, etc. That makes them more vulnerable.


  Finally, the least desired consequence in the situation of type 1 diabetes and pregnancy is spontaneous abortion, which usually occurs before 20 weeks of gestation.


  ## The importance of glycemic control during pregnancy


  At this point, you may ask yourself, why so much emphasis on glycemic control? Good because during pregnancy it has been proven that it is a bit more difficult to keep blood sugar levels under control; This is due to changes in "the effect" of insulin in your body, or changes in its absorption and metabolism, all this causes it to be a little more complex to establish an adequate adjustment of insulin doses, especially in the last weeks of pregnancy.


  An option developed by health technology in recent years are continuous monitoring systems, with which you can see blood sugar concentrations in real time, keeping them away from hyper or hypoglycemia and therefore having better blood sugar values. glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and helping pregnant women keep their values ​​within the recommended range for about 3 more hours each day.


  Always keep in mind that the best care is given if you attend timely with your treating doctors, it is common that during this stage you require more frequent visits to the doctor, but it is for your health and that of your baby. Prenatal checkups and adjustments in your insulin levels are essential for you to have a healthy baby.

  ## Type 1 Diabetes and Pregnancy: Importance of Diet During Pregnancy


  Another point of interest to take into account before or at the beginning of pregnancy is the consumption of essential nutrients in the pregnant woman. We refer to an adequate consumption of proteins, essential fats (especially [omega 3 fatty acids](https://dediabetes.com/cuanto-es-el-nivel-normal-de-glucosa/) ), vitamins such as folic acid and vitamin B12, as well as essential minerals such as iron and calcium. Most are achieved through a good diet, a Nutritionist-Dietitian could help you achieve this goal, you can even consult a specialist whether or not you need a supplement or nutritional supplement. Additionally, you should avoid the consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and other drugs as much as possible during this stage.


  Exercise is a fundamental part of the treatment of diabetes, therefore you must keep it present during a situation of type 1 diabetes and pregnancy. Generally, maintaining a good level of physical activity during pregnancy helps control blood glucose and keep you in shape after pregnancy. Walks of at least 30 minutes at least 5 times a week are a good place to start.


  So now you know, don't be afraid, you just need to plan your pregnancy, consult with your doctors, prepare to live the experience and receive your baby with the greatest joy.
