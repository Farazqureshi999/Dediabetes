                <h1>How we use cookies
                </h1>
                <p>A cookie is a small file that asks for permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once
                    you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you
                    visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web
                    application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes, and dislikes by gathering and
                    remembering information about your preferences.

                </p>
                <p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about
                    web traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this
                    information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

                </p>
                <p>In general, cookies help us provide you with a better website by allowing us to control which pages
                    you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any
                    information about you, except the data that you choose to share with us.

                </p>
                <p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you
                    can modify your browser settings to reject cookies, if you prefer. This can prevent you from taking
                    advantage of the entire web page.

                </p>
                <h1>Anti-spam policy
                </h1>
                <p>The provider declares itself completely against the sending of unsolicited commercial communications
                    and any type of conduct or manifestation known as "spam", it also declares itself committed to the
                    fight against this type of abusive practices.

                </p>
                <p>Therefore, the provider guarantees the user that under no circumstances will the personal data
                    collected on the website be transferred, shared, transferred, or sold to any third party.

                </p>
                <p>For the same reasons, the registration process should not be used to register email addresses of
                    outsiders without the express consent of the affected persons. Dediabetes implements as a
                    countermeasure to these practices a double opt-in mailing list that requires explicit confirmation
                    from the owner of the email account indicated as the subscription address, before receiving
                    communications by email.

                </p>
                <p>In the event that a user still receives communications from this website without having registered,
                    or without having given their express consent to said registration, they can cancel the subscription
                    from the links provided in the communication itself. In addition, the user can contact us through
                    the
                </p>
                <p>contact form that is maintained on the website, both to communicate what happened and to request the
                    immediate elimination of their data from our system.
