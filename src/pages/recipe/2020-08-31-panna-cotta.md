  ### Ingredients


  * 300 ml cream (or heavy cream)

  * 300 ml skim milk

  * 20 gr granulated or powdered sweetener

  * 10 gr unflavored gelatin

  * lemon zest


  #### For coverage:


  * 1 tablet unsweetened dark chocolate

  * 50 gr heavy cream

  * Raspberries or natural strawberries


  ### Step-by-step elaboration


  1. In a deep pot, heat the cream with the skim milk, the lemon zest and the sweetener (without bringing to a boil) over medium-low heat.

  2. Remove from the heat and add the gelatin (previously hydrated in a couple of teaspoons of water or warm milk).

  3. Stir until dissolved and serve in individual molds.

  4. Refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm.


  #### For coverage:


  1. Melt the chocolate with the cream in a bain-marie until it reaches a creamy consistency.


  #### Mounting:


  1. Once the panna cotta has reached a firm consistency in the fridge, cover with the topping and let it cool for another 20 minutes (if you prefer the chocolate to be softer and melted, it is not necessary to cool it).
