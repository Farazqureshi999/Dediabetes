  ### Ingredients


  * 1 package Sugar-free cookies (amount to taste)

  * 350 ml evaporated milk

  * 1/2 cup lemon juice

  * 20 gr Powdered or granulated sweetener

  * Lemon zest


  ### Step-by-step elaboration


  1. Put the milk to cool in the fridge for two hours.

  2. Whisk the evaporated milk until it rises (doubled in size), this process can take around 15 minutes (if you have trouble getting the milk to double in size, place the container in which you are whisking the milk over a bowl of ice, the cold will help the milk to incorporate air and rise in size).

  3. Add the lemon juice, the zest of the lemon peel and the sweetener.

  4. Crush the cookies.

  5. Place the mixture in a large mold and cover with the cookies and a little zest.

  6. Freeze.

  7. Remove from the freezer approximately 5 minutes before serving - to soften.
