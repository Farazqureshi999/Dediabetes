intro: >-
  * The hectic day to day has led us to neglect our diet, and it makes it
  difficult for us to maintain efficient control of glycemia (blood sugar)

  * Poor control of glycemia (blood sugar) can create acute complications (hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome) and chronic (kidney damage: nephropathy, peripheral nerve damage: neuropathy, damage of the retina: retinopathy).

  * On the other hand, scientific studies suggest that in this hectic life, we have reduced the variety in our food, we only use between 10 to 15 common preparations during the week

  * Long working hours, the cost of some foods, and the limited time available have led most to turn to fast foods or other options that are not always healthy.


  *This diabetic diet guide allows you to eat a nutritious and rewarding diet so you can control your blood sugar (glycemic) levels as well as your body weight.*
